# Commands I learned Recently:

#### git init
creates a git repository in the current directory.

#### git status
tells about commits done and untracked files in the current directory.


#### git add file.txt
adds file.txt to the stage.

#### git commit -m "your message"
does the commits for the files on stage and saves this message alongwith this commit.


#### git branch branchname
Creates a branch named 'branchname'.


#### git checkout branchname
gives the head of our working tree to the branch 'branchname'.


#### git push origin*(or upstream)* branchname
pushes the branch 'branchname' to our fork online.

          
           


*And many more commands*
          
          
  
  
  
          
# Some new terminoligies/concepts and their description:


#### Client-side
The Client-side involves the actions taking place on the user’s (the client’s) computer.

#### Server-side
Server-side means that the action takes place on a web server.

*(clientside and serverside are analogous to frontend and backend)*

#### HTTP Protocol
A protocol is a system of rules that define how data is exchanged within or between computers. HTTP is a protocol that allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web, and it is a **client-server protocol**, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.

#### HTTP V/S HTTPS PROTOCOLS
HTTP and HTTPS are two protocols different in their security during request and response transfer between the client and web server.
HTTPS is a secured protocol (encrypted ) while HTTP is not.HTTP operates at the application layer, while HTTPS operates at the transport layer.

#### Frameworks V/S Libraries
Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways. However, the difference between them lies here- When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. Whereas, When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.
